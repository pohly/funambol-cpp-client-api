/**
 * This is the interface expected by the testing framework for sync
 * clients.  It defines several methods that a derived class must
 * implement if it wants to use that framework. Note that this class
 * itself is not derived from SyncClient. This gives a user of this
 * framework the freedom to implement it in two different ways:
 * - implement a class derived from both SyncClient and ClientTest
 * - add testing of an existing subclass of SyncClient by implementing
 *   a ClientTest which uses that subclass
 *
 * The client is expected to support change tracking for multiple
 * servers. Although the framework always always tests against the
 * same server, for most tests it is necessary to access the database
 * without affecting the next synchronization with the server. This is
 * done by asking the client for another sync source which it must
 * create in a suitable way - pretty much as if the client was
 * synchronized against different server.
 *
 * Furthermore the client is expected to support multiple data sources
 * of the same kind, f.i. two different address books. This is used to
 * test full client A <-> server <-> client B synchronizations in some
 * tests or to check server modifications done by client A with a
 * synchronization against client B. In those tests client A is mapped
 * to the first data source and client B to the second one.
 *
 * Finally the SyncSource API is used in slightly different ways which
 * go beyond what is normally expected from a SyncSource implementation:
 * - beginSync() may be called without setting a sync mode:
 *   when SyncSource::getSyncMode() returns SYNC_NONE the source is
 *   expected to make itself ready to iterate over all, new, updated and
 *   deleted items
 * - items may be added via SyncSource::addItem() with a type of "raw":
 *   this implies that the type is the one used for items in the
 *   ClientTest::Config below
 *
 * Handling configuration and creating classes is entirely done by the
 * subclass of ClientTest, the frameworks makes no assumptions
 * about how this is done. Instead it queries the ClientTest for
 * properties (like available sync sources) and then creates several
 * tests.
