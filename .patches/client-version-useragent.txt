(Curl)TransportAgent:
- did not set userAgent member in constructor,
  causing an uninitialized memory read in the
  CurlTransportAgent constructor
- CurlTransportAgent needs to be notified of
  userAgent modifications, therefore made all
  calls in TransportAgent virtual and added
  CurlTransportAgent::setUserAgent

Client API:
- SyncClient replaces Sync4jClient: API is backwards
  compatible, code using Sync4jClient compiles without
  changes
- SyncClient is expected to be subclassed by client
  to override certain functions which will be called
  by SyncManager, but reasonable defaults will be
  provided for all such calls

SyncManager:
- the new SyncClient::getClientID() is used as default
  value for the HTTP user agent string if nothing was
  specified in the config
- fix for uninitialized memory (and potential crashes)
  when constructing a SyncManager and immediately
  deleting it again
