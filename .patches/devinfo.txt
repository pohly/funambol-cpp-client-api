This patch adds support for sending device info. They are constructed
from new SyncClient and SyncSource API calls and configuration
information. A client does not have to implement any calls, default
implementations of the calls fill provide reasonable defaults for
required properties or leave them empty.

DevInf is actively sent as part of a Put if they have changed since
the last time, the new "syncml/devInfHash" property stores a hash of
the DevInf string to detect that.

Sending DevInf as part of Results in reply to a Get is also supported
(tested with Synthesis server).

While implementing this, several related changes were made:
- added "const" whenever necessary
- fixed spelling of tag names
- instead of implementing the copying of devInfHash into a new
  SyncSource property, the code was refactored so that a SyncSource
  now has a SyncSourceConfig
