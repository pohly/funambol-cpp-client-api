Fixes several problems in combination with Synthesis (and probably
other) servers:
- CDATA in <Data></Data> parts not supported
- escape & and < with CDATA because the Synthesis server only supports that;
  is also cheaper to do at runtime (no replaceAll).
- bugfix: code which replaced &amp; and &lt; was unconditionally applied
  at high levels and broke e.g. <Add><Data><![CDATA[ literal entity &amp; ]]></Data></Add>
  but it was also applied multiple times to the same text and thus might have
  incorrectly replaced &amp;amp; with & although &amp; would have been correct
- <LocName> required for MD5 authentication
- after failed authentication <SourceRef> might be missing in reply,
  ignore it
- moved code into new SyncManager::checkForServerChanges() to deal with
  server <Sync> which might come before the 222 alert and wasn't expected
  there by the client without this patch
- several XML tags must have the xmlns parameter to be accepted as valid XML
