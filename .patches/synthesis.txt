Fixes several problems in combination with Synthesis (and probably
other) servers:
- CDATA in <Data></Data> parts
- <LocName> required for MD5 authentication
- after failed authentication <SourceRef> might be missing in reply,
  ignore it
- moved code into new SyncManager::checkForServerChanges() to deal with
  server <Sync> which might come before the 222 alert and wasn't expected
  there by the client without this patch
- several XML tags must have the xmlns parameter to be accepted as valid XML
