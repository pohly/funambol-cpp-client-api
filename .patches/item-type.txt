A SyncSource is allowed to deliver items of different types
as long as the server knows how to deal with them. That the
C++ client library used the configured type instead of the
one from the SyncItem is an unnecessary restriction, removed
by this patch.

For backwards compatibility with (IMHO broken) SyncSources
which do not use SyncItem->setType() the SyncSource's type
is still used as fallback - as far as I am concerned, this
parameter should be removed.

Note that SyncEvolution is affected because it uses different
strings in the configured type to determine which kind of
database backend needs to be accessed (calendar or tasks)
although items from both sources have "text/calendar" as type.
