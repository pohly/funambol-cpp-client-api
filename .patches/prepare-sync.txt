- add SyncSource::prepareSync()
- adds several comments to clarify what the prepare/begin/endSync()
  are allowed and expected to do
- replaces one getSyncMode() with getPreferredSyncMode() because at
  that time getSyncMode() normally wouldn't be set yet
- if an error has been set already in SyncManager::beginSync(), do
  not overwrite it with a follow-up error
- the prepare/begin/endSync() all have empty default implementations:
  that means that clients not implementing the new prepareSync()
  still work and while I made that change, I applied the same logic
  to the other functions for consistency reasons (and those sources
  which really do not need these functions...)
