The vCard 2.1 standard uses "BASE64" as encoding
whereas 3.0 uses "B" or "b" instead.

This patch changes the underlying parser so that
they are synonyms and treats them alike, regardless of
the version. It also fixes the bug that after such
binary encoded data an extra line break gets added
(forge.objectweb #305112).

TODO: most of classes on top of VObject still use
"BASE64" only and need to be fixed for 3.0 vCards.
