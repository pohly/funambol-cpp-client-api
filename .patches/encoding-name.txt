The vCard 2.1 standard uses "BASE64" as encoding
whereas 3.0 uses "B" or "b" instead. An extra blank
line is needed for 2.1, but not for 3.0.

This patch fixes the problem that for 2.1 a
  \r\n<space>\r\n
is added after a BASE64 property and adapts the
vcardconverter test program to switch between
the two encoding names.
