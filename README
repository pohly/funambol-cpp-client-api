Building
========

To build for a certain platform, go to the
subdirectory in "build" which matches your
platform and follow the instructions there.
"build/autotools" uses the normal GNU
configure/make tools and works for Unix/Linux.

Patches
=======

The .patches directory contains patches which
have not been imported CVS yet, usually because
the current branch is frozen in preparation for
a release.

They can be applied automatically with Holger
Schurig's patcher utility:
  http://www.holgerschurig.de/patcher.html
This simple Perl script can be downloaded from
that page, but is also packaged as part of
e.g. Debian 3.1 (Sarge).

To just apply the patches:
- enter the "client-api/native" directory
- enter "patcher -A"

This utility can also be used to create new
patches or to update existing ones: this might
be necessary when the regular files in CVS have
been modified since the time when the patch
was created or when some patches have been
applied in the meantime.
