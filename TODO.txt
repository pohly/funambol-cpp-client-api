API TODO LIST
-------------

1) Features SyncML:
    1 Large Object Support
    1 Handle status of items (if an item was sent successful don't send it again)
    2 SyncML DM: implement tree and new syncml classes
    3 Suspend/resume (3.5)

2) Interoperability/portability:
    1 Apply the patches for Synthesis and verify them with the other
      plugins.
    1 Implement devinfo (the SyncML objects are already there, changes needed
      in Parser/Formatter and API).
    1 64 bits support
    1 char / wchar use.
        2 remove wchar


3) API interface:
    1 Make object ownership more clear (use of const, inline documentation)
    1 The SyncItems are created by the source and release by the engine
    1 Event Handling (create default implementation)
    1 SyncSource failure handling
    2 VOCL support for vCard 3.0 and iCal 2.1...
